# Remove Pair Programming

## Summary

We simply need to remove the pairing section, in it's entirety from WD101.

## Motivation

I think that everyone generally agrees that pair programming is one way to boost your learning progress, and that's the reason that it was initially added to the curriculum here.  HOWEVER, it is really difficult for students to find pairs.  We see people asking almost every day, with (as far as I can tell) a nearly 0% success rate.  Every completion of the pomodoro project that I can think of was done by a single person on their own.

Due to the self-pacing and self-direction of our curriculum it is unreasonable for most of our students to think they can find someone to pair with and we should simply remove that section.

## Basic Outline

...

## Drawbacks

- Losing the pomodoro project.  This one _is_ a solid project.  It sits nicely on the difficulty curve for most students at that time and makes a solid portfolio piece.
- Pairing _is_ a useful tool after all.. it just seems prohibitively difficult for most of our students.

## Alternatives

We have tried spitballing ways to organize students but I haven't seen a reasonable solution.

Perhaps sending more experienced students back to pair with noobs could be tied into gamification at some point... but again it's not really clear how that should be organized.
