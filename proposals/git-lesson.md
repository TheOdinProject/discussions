# New Intro to Git Lesson

## Summary

 Create basic intro to git lesson on our site rather than point to a new resource.

## Motivation

The Git Tower lesson in the [Git Basics Lesson](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/master/web_development_101/git_basics/git_basics.md) seems to be confusing new learners since it often makes reference to files that they don't have or are expected to create.

Since this is intro material and git doesn't appear to change significantly or often, it would make sense to create our own lesson so that we no longer need to point to an external resource.

## Basic Outline

Learners would be invited to do the following:

- Initialize git repo in exercise folder.
- Create files that will be tracked throughout exercise.
- Use commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git status` to manage their files.
- Create a `.gitignore` file and learn what types of files are typically ignored.

## Potential Resources

Will reference the [Pro Git E-book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) to inform lesson content.

## Drawbacks



## Alternatives

An alternative to writing our own resource would be to identify a free resource that provides a gentle introduction to Git. This can be explored if it is later decided that we don't want to keep our own intro lesson.
