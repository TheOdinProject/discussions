## Discord Landing Page

### The Odin Project and Discord are 100% completely free
It may sound unbelievable, but The Odin Project and our official Discord server are available at no cost. In addition, the volunteer team of people that wrote and maintain the curriculum are very active on Discord!

### It is important to learn how to ask thorough questions
If you have a different question, you are invited to join our Discord community to ask! Asking questions may sound easy, but asking a thorough question does not happen naturally. 

Before asking your first question, it is very important for you to read and follow the following: [before asking for help](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/join-the-odin-community#before-asking-for-help), [asking for help](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/join-the-odin-community#asking-for-help), [formatting your questions](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/join-the-odin-community#formatting-your-questions)

### Guidelines
Before joining our Discord community, here are some guidelines before you dive in: 
  
* **Ping (@user) With a Purpose:** Only @ another user when it is necessary. Include your question or comment in the message. Wait until they reply before pinging again.	
* **Don't 'Bomb' Chats:** Don't send multiple messages in a row, type out your whole message, then push send. If you want to have a line break, you can use shift + enter.
* **Don't Exclude Anyone:**	These are public chats, if someone joins in on a conversation, include them!		
* **Don't Disappear Right After Asking for Help on Code:** If you're posting a question, make sure you have time to stick around and discuss it with those trying to help!
* **Remember the Human:** Behind every username there is a person with feelings! Be kind! If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. 
* **If You Wouldn't Say It Out Loud Don't Type It:** Plain and simple.

### Join Discord
Now that you know that we are a completely **free** resource, how to ask thorough questions, and are aware of the guidelines, you can join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hvqVr6d). When you join, you will automatically be in our `#rules` channel. Read all of the rules thoroughly and then you will be given access to the the rest of the channels. 

Introduce yourself in the `#introductions-and-checkins` channel, then explore all of the individual channels for every topic covered in our curriculum and more! 

Take a few minutes to configure your settings. If all the channels are overwhelming, learn how to mute channels that you do not want to see. If you do not want any notifications, learn how to disable them.

Finally, link your GitHub to your Discord profile, so others can see what you're working on!
* Discord Settings > Connections > Click GitHub icon > Allow Access > Make sure "Display on profile" is toggled on.
