# Discord Landing Page

## Summary

Currently, anyone can access our Discord server from anywhere on our website, which made sense when we had the forum and the discord channel. There is a lesson in Foundations about joining the Odin community and I think it would be very beneficial to have everyone read that material before the join Discord. 

## Motivation

As our community grows, I think it would be very helpful to make sure that everyone is on the same page when they join Discord. In addition, I think we should expand on this information to include a few additional topics.

The recent suggestion of adding a "Odin Discord Helping Guide" is another example of information that would be very useful for everyone to read when they join Discord. 

In addition, a "Frequently Asked Discord Questions" section could be very useful because these types of questions are answered inconsistently on Discord depending on who is answering it. This section will not completely eliminate these questions, because there will always be people who think their situation is special and will ask anyway. However, we should see a reduction of these questions. In addition, if we have a published generic answer, then others will be empowered to help point people to the correct answer.

In the long run, we could add commands to the discord bot, so that we can easily point people back to this material.

## Basic Outline
Here is a list of the major points that I would like to have on the Discord Landing Page:
- We are 100% free
- Frequently Asked Discord Questions
- How to Ask a Thorough Question (from Foundations/Join the Odin Community lesson)
- Guidelines (from Foundations/Join the Odin Community lesson)
- Discord Tips, such as configuring notifications
- How to Help Others Solve Coding Problems

## Drawbacks

The only major drawback that I can see is that this would be additional content to maintain because some of the information may change or evolve as time passes.

The other drawback is that this is becoming a significant amount of material. I am fully aware that people may not read everything. However, this is a place that we can link to when people need a reminder.

## Alternatives

Instead of including all of this content on one page, we could break it up into different pages that might make it easier to reference an entire page, rather than just a small section on a long page.

## Additional

The idea of a discord landing page has come up in several conversations. Two recent examples were during the [social media discussion](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/discussions/issues/43) and in the maintainers channel when we discussed adding a "Odin Discord Helping Guide".
