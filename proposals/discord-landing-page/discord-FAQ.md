### Please review our most common questions 
Over one hundred people join our Discord server every day. As you can imagine, we are frequently asked the same questions, so please take a moment to review the following questions. 

#### How long does The Odin Project take to complete?
* The amount of time that it takes to complete our curriculum varies greatly from person to person. 
* Our curriculum is self paced and allows you to get a really sold grasp of each concept before moving on. Everyone takes a different amount of time to grasp each concept.
* We've seen people that barely knew how to check their email become successful through our curriculum, but it probably took them a bit longer than someone who has a computer science degree. 
* No matter your background, our curriculum can teach you everything you need to know to be a entry level web developer. However, if you are looking for a quick turn-around from a 6-12 week bootcamp style program, then we are probably not the right fit for you. If you are considering a bootcamp, please take the time to research your best option. In addition, be aware that bootcamps can be a [scam](https://twitter.com/lzsthw/status/1212284566431576069).

#### Is learning web development useless with sites like WordPress or Wix?
* Sites like WordPress or Wix focus on creating brochure websites.
* Our curriculum goes beyond these brochure websites. We teach how to program web applications, such as twitter, facebook or pinterest.

#### Do I have to install a Virtual Machine or Dual-Boot?
* If you would like technical support from our Discord community, you must follow our [prerequisites](/courses/foundations/lessons/prerequisites). Just like you wouldn't use a different book than your teacher requires and then ask your teacher to help you understand your book.
* Our volunteer team have chosen to only support the most beginner-friendly operating systems. We have used and tested other operating systems and experienced countless issues that could not be easily resolved.
* In addition, MacOS and Linux are the most commonly used operating systems in the industry for the technologies covered in our curriculum. You will be getting real-world experience when you use one of our prerequisites.
* If you choose to ignore our prerequisites, you will have to rely on your own troubleshooting skills when you run into problems.

#### How should I take notes?
* Even with the best note-taking skills and organization, we have found that most students that take notes do not use them.
* This may sound shocking, but programmers are not expected to know everything off the top of their head. Instead, they rely on knowing where to look for the information they need, such as documentation. 
* A well-worded google search is quicker than looking through old notes or even trying to find a bookmarked website. 

#### I feel lost. How do I begin this project?
* Our curriculum takes a different approach than most other free resources. This feeling of being lost is because you are expecting us to hand-hold you every step of the way and to spoon-feed you all the information that you need. We encourage you to embrace this feeling and learn how to break down the project into small, individual steps.
* Unless you have skipped some material, you can be assured that you have been exposed to all the major concepts involved in the project. If you feel completely lost, read through the entire project, then begin reviewing the lessons leading up to it. Sometimes you do not fully understand a concept, until you see a reason to use it. 
* In addition, you are highly encouraged to use documentation and to google specific concepts, such as "how to center text inside a div" instead of "how to replicate the google homepage". 
* It is normal to feel a bit lost when you begin a new project. This is similar to climbing a mountain and wanting to see the entire path up the mountain before you begin. The entire path is never completely visible from the bottom. You reach the top of the mountain by taking it one step at a time. With each step that you take, you will see more of the path in front of you. Similarly when you complete each small step in your project, you will see the next step more clearly. 

#### Why do the student solutions look more advanced than my current skill?
* Resist the urge to look at the code of a submitted project until you have finished your own project. Learning from a submitted project is like learning how to make pizza dough from looking at a baked pizza. The final product does not show the countless steps or the refactoring process.
* Student solutions may look more advanced, because some students already had development experience when they started our curriculum.
* In addition, students often go back to their earlier projects to refactor them for their portfolio. 

#### Should I do JavaScript or Ruby on Rails path?
* Do not worry about choosing one until you have reach the last lesson of Foundations because it will help you make your decision.
* If you just completed that lesson and are still struggling with this decision, there really is nothing more that we can say. You can not go wrong with either path because it is very common for a student to go through one and end up getting a job using the other technology. 

#### Isn't Ruby on Rails dying?
* Although Ruby on Rails is not currently as popular as JavaScript/Node, it is not in any immediate danger of dying or becoming obsolete. 
* There are plenty of job opportunities using Ruby on Rails. In addition, it provides an excellent foundation of programming fundamentals, such as Object-Orientated Programming (OOP).

#### Does The Odin Project website have a dark mode?
Yes! We currently have extensions for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-odin-project-dark-the/omiecnmmajomefpodcdjkebeonieonef?hl=en-US) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/the-odin-project-dark-theme/).

#### Can I translate this curriculum into another language?
* Many people have inquired about this possibility and you could translate our content, but according to our license, you must keep it completely **free** to use. 
* In addition, our curriculum uses a lot of external sources, therefore you would have to contact all of the authors and get permission to translate their material. If you get turned down, you would have to find an equivalent resource or write your own.
* Finally, our curriculum is updated on a daily basis by a whole community of people, so a translation of our curriculum could quickly become outdated or would need to be constantly updated.

#### How can I show my appreciation?
The best way to show your appreciation is [contributing](/contributing) back to our community and answering student questions on Discord.
