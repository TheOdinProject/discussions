### Discord Rules
 
#### 1. Do not ask to ask a question
You have permission to ask your specific question in the proper channel. Please do not ask for explicit permission to ask your question; that is unnecessary and forces people to wait for your actual question. We know you mean well, but the result is somewhat inconsiderate. More info here: https://dontasktoask.com/
 
#### 2. Ask good questions, in the proper channel
We encourage questions, so do not worry about asking a "stupid question". However, please research your question using a search engine first. Questions are more likely to get answered if you show what you are trying to do, and the things that you've tried. This article is fantastic resource: https://medium.com/@gordon_zhu/how-to-be-great-at-asking-questions-e37be04d0603
 
#### 3. No cross-posting
Post your question in one and only one channel before waiting for a response. Cross posting will not get you an answer sooner, and it will split the discussion into redundant and/or conflicting answers. Directing people to your question is a better strategy than reposting it.
 
#### 4. Use external services for code sharing
Posting small snippets of code is acceptable, but anything longer than a few lines is hard to read and parse. Do not upload files for people to download. Use http://pastebin.com/ for long error messages. Use http://repl.it/ for code examples.
 
#### 5. Have good etiquette
Racist remarks, sexually oriented remarks, and religious persecution will not be tolerated. Any such remarks will result in an immediate ban. This includes doxing. Do not post personal information. Do not post or discuss NSFL/NSFW, illegal, or sexual content.
 
#### 6. No political topics
This is a very diverse community; there are people from many different ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic backgrounds. Do not post or discuss any topic that could be perceived as political to anyone; it can be divisive and is overall unproductive to empowering each other to become developers.
 
#### 7. Do not DM people
Do not send an unsolicited DM to anyone. Everyone in this community is a volunteer and shares the responsibility to answer questions. It is unfair to expect one person to answer your question. If all questions are public, other people can benefit from learning the answer.
 
**Note:** If you are given a warning by a member of the Core or Maintainers team, please do not take it personally or be argumentative. We do not give warnings lightly; we are dedicated to keep this community a safe and welcoming place for everyone.


### How to Help Others Solve Coding Problems
https://nedbatchelder.com//blog/202009/how_to_be_helpful_online.html

#### 1. Help only with problems you are certain you know how to solve in the correct way.
* It’s great to want to help other people in their coding journey, but if your advice is bad, you are actually doing more harm than good. Before responding, ask yourself, “Am I 100% sure I know the right way to solve this problem?”
* If the question seems confusing or ambiguous, ask for more clarity, or kindly link them to /question.

#### 2. Try to not give the answer straight-up.
*  As a learner, it is easy to feel demoralized by problems you don’t know how to solve. When someone asks for help, giving them the answer can be a defeating experience, because they know they didn’t figure it out themselves. Additionally, you are not doing them any favors as a learner by giving them the answer.
* Instead, try asking good questions to lead them toward figuring the problem out for themselves, such as “What do you expect this function to do?”, or “What do you think that error means?” This teaches good debugging skills and helps the asker feel more confident in their ability to solve problems.
* If the problem is a simple typo or missed character it's okay to point that out.

#### 3. Be patient.
* Try not to begin helping someone with a large problem if you don’t have time to spend seeing the problem through for a few minutes.

#### 4. If the asker lacks serious knowledge, point them to the resource they should brush up on, gracefully.
* It's common to start getting impatient as a student, or think we know more than we actually do - it happens to everyone. If you are helping a student who seems way over their head, kindly encourage them to go back and reread a section of the curriculum they are not understanding.
  
#### 5. Know when the problem is over your own head, and duck out.
* Sometimes there are multiple problems, or the issue you are helping with escalated over your head. That’s okay! Just admit when things are above your knowledge level and wait for someone more experienced to come along.
