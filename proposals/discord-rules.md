## Discord Rules 
(updated December 2020)


Welcome to The Odin Project!

After reading the rules, you will be given access to the rest of The Odin Project's Chat!

**1. Do not ask to ask a question**
You have permission to ask your specific question in the proper channel. Please do not ask for explicit permission to ask your question; that is unnecessary and forces people to wait for your actual question. We know you mean well, but the result is somewhat inconsiderate. More info here: https://dontasktoask.com/

**2. Ask thorough questions**
We encourage questions, so do not worry about asking a "stupid question". However, please research your question using a search engine first. Questions are more likely to get answered if you show what you are trying to do and the things that you've tried. This article is a fantastic resource: https://medium.com/@gordon_zhu/how-to-be-great-at-asking-questions-e37be04d0603

**3. Ask questions in the proper channel**
We have specific channels for every section in our curriculum. Please ask your question in the most relevant channel. We do not support material outside of our curriculum, so please ask those questions elsewhere.

**4. No cross-posting**
Post your question in one and only one channel before waiting for a response. Cross posting will not get you an answer sooner, and it will split the discussion into redundant and/or conflicting answers. Directing people to your question is a better strategy than reposting it.
 
**5. Use external services for code sharing**
Posting small snippets of code is acceptable, but anything longer than a few lines is hard to read and parse. Do not upload files for people to download. Use http://pastebin.com/ for long error messages. Use http://repl.it/ for code examples.
 
**6. Have good etiquette**
Racist remarks, sexually oriented remarks, and religious persecution will not be tolerated. Any such remarks will result in an immediate ban. This includes doxing. Do not post personal information. Do not post or discuss NSFL/NSFW, illegal, or sexual content.
 
**7. No political or religious topics**
This is a very diverse community; there are people from many different ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic backgrounds. Do not post or discuss any topic that could be perceived as political or religious to anyone; it can be divisive and hinder our ability to empower each other to become developers.
 
**8. Do not DM people**
Do not send an unsolicited DM to anyone. Everyone in this community is a volunteer and shares the responsibility to answer questions. It is unfair to expect one person to answer your question. If all questions are public, other people can benefit from learning the answer.

**9. No piracy**
Piracy is illegal. Discussion on how to pirate, links to pirated materials, or suggesting someone pirate intellectual property will not be tolerated.

**10. Do not ask for life advice**
Seeking advice related to the goals of the community should be asked in the relevant channels. If you are seeking advice on relationships, depression, mental illness, or anything else that falls outside of the scope of our server, please seek out the appropriate resource.
 
**Note:** If you are given a warning by a member of the Core or Maintainers team, please do not take it personally or be argumentative. We do not give warnings lightly; we are dedicated to keeping this community a safe and welcoming place for everyone.

**Please click the "OK" emoji below this message** to agree to these rules and you will be granted access to the rest of The Odin Project's channels.
