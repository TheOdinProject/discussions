## Discord Rules 
(updated March 2021)


Welcome to The Odin Project!

After reading the rules, you will be given access to the rest of The Odin Project's Chat!

**1. Do not ask to ask a question**
You have permission to ask your specific question in the proper channel, so please do not ask for explicit permission to ask your question. We know you mean well, but it is somewhat inconsiderate to make people wait for your actual question. More info here: https://dontasktoask.com/

**2. Ask thorough questions**
We encourage questions, so do not worry about asking a "stupid question". However, please research your question using a search engine first. Questions are more likely to get answered if you show what you are trying to do and the things that you've tried. This article is a fantastic resource: https://medium.com/@gordon_zhu/how-to-be-great-at-asking-questions-e37be04d0603

**3. Ask questions in the proper channel**
We have specific channels for every section in our curriculum, so please ask your question in the most relevant channel. We do not support material outside of our curriculum, so please ask those questions elsewhere.

**4. No cross-posting**
Post your question in one and only one channel before waiting for a response. Cross posting will not get you an answer sooner, and it will split the discussion into redundant and/or conflicting answers. Directing people to your question is a better strategy than reposting it.

**5. Use external services for code sharing**
Posting small snippets of code is acceptable, but anything longer than a few lines is hard to read and parse. Do not upload files for people to download. Use http://pastebin.com/ for long error messages. Use http://repl.it/ for code examples.

**6. Do not ping or DM people**
Do not send anyone an unsolicited ping or DM. Everyone in this community is a volunteer and shares the responsibility to answer questions. It is unfair to expect specific people to answer your question.

**7. Have good etiquette**
Do not post personal information. Do not post or discuss NSFL/NSFW, illegal, or sexual content.
Racist remarks, sexually oriented remarks, and religious persecution will not be tolerated. Any such remarks will result in an immediate ban. This includes doxing. 

**8. No political or religious topics**
This is a diverse community; there are people from many different ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic backgrounds. Do not post any topic that could be perceived as political or religious because it can be divisive and hinder our ability to help each other.

**9. No piracy**
Piracy is illegal. Discussion on how to pirate, links to pirated materials, or suggesting someone pirate intellectual property will not be tolerated.

**10. Do not dog-pile**
If somebody is already getting help, do not jump in the middle of the conversation. We know you mean well, but it is overwhelming for the person receiving help to follow multiple conversations. 

**11. This community only supports the content in our curriculum**
This community is run by the same volunteers that wrote and maintain the curriculum. All questions and advice should stay within the scope of our curriculum. We are not equipped to support anything that falls outside of this scope.

**12. Seek out other resources for things outside of our curriculum**
If you are seeking advice on alternative operating systems, homework, personal projects, relationships, depression, mental illness, or anything else outside the scope of our curriculum, please seek out more equipped resources.
 
**Note:** If you are given a warning by a member of the Core or Maintainers team, please do not take it personally or be argumentative. We do not give warnings lightly; we are dedicated to keeping this community a safe and welcoming place for everyone.

**Please click the "OK" emoji below this message** to agree to these rules and you will be granted access to the rest of The Odin Project's channels.
