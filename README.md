# discussions
This repository is for all discussions related to The Odin Project. The ones where we need to inform everyone involved in the project about something, or figure out a policy about something, or make a decision of some sort. This is the repository for philosophical discussions, for asking clarifying questions, for discussing priorities. If your a student or are interested in Odin this is the repository where you can find out whats in store for the project in the future.

The actual discussions can be found in the [issues](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/discussions/issues) section.
