# The Odin Project Proposals and Discussions

## Discussions
This repository is for all discussions related to The Odin Project. The ones where we need to inform everyone involved in the project about something, or figure out a policy about something, or make a decision of some sort. This is the repository for philosophical discussions, for asking clarifying questions, for discussing priorities. If your a student or are interested in Odin this is the repository where you can find out whats in store for the project in the future.

The actual discussions can be found in the [issues](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/discussions/issues) section.

## Project Planning

This repository will also be home to any project planning. Please use the provided `proposals` folder to submit a project proposal. Projects will then be tracked via TOPs [Project Overview](https://github.com/orgs/TheOdinProject/projects/4) project.

An example proposal will be created for you to follow. Please use this as an example of how to set up and manage a proposal.


## Meeting Minutes

Additionally, all meeting minutes will be saved and filed under the `meeting-minutes` directory. File names should be in the following format: `YYYY-MM-DD-MeetingType`
