# Standup Meeting

Date: 2020-05-26

Attendees: Ryan, Leo, Briggs, Carlos, Cody

## From last week:

* Student Submissions 
  * We're close!! (following up with Kevin on that)

* Rails course stuff
  * No new news.. apparently progress is being made

* Live coding schedule/organization
  * Seems to be going smoothly
  * leo has added a schedule to the discussions repo.

* Proposal approval process (issue with voting comment)
  * Need to figure out a real process for this......
  * decided to stick with the issue for now until some better process comes along.

* Moving track choice
  * SHould probably happen, but it's a complex problem that warrants more discussion
  * Cody's idea: maybe make 101 it's own track so it is _super obvious_ that everyone starts there.
     - problems with this include people never making it to the other tracks, and people skipping it because they think it's too basic.
     -  (Cody: I still think it's a good idea tho ;) )
